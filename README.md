# Stash2lesschat

Plugin subscribes to Stash server events and send notifications to 
lesschat channels.

Currently the following events are supported:

* PullRequestActivity - Event that is raised when an activity is created for a pull request.
* RepositoryPushEvent - Event that is raised when a user pushes one or more refs to a repository

## Installation

Grab the latest release, and upload it to your stash instance on 
the manage addons page.

## Configuration

You need to create a stash service web hook in lesschat. That will give you the
hook url and the default channel name. Notifications will go to the
defaul lesschat channel, unless you override them in the configuration for
a given repository.

You can enter the webhook url in the global settings. Just go to
http://your.stash.host/plugins/servlet/lesschat-global-settings/admin and
edit the hook url.

Then for each repository, you can enable the notifications. Go to your
repository page, select Settings, lesschat settings. There are two check boxes,
one for enabling notifications for pull requests, and one for push activities.

You can also enter a custom channel name here, if you want your notifications
to go to a different channel, and also a custom webhook url which overrides
the default hook url, if it is set.
